      <h2>Difference</h2>

      <p>
        Supporting us will not only help in making a positive impact on those
        struggling with mental health, but also sound the alarm on injustice in
        the healthcare industry. Many people struggling with mental health often
        feel unseen and unheard. Through websites like ours, we can help
        individuals feel valued and supported in many meaningful ways. Remember,
        everyone has the opportunity to make a difference in the world we live
        in!
